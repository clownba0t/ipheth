iPhone USB Ethernet Driver for Linux
------------------------------------

Compile the driver:

$ make

Install the driver:

$ make install

A modprobe configuration file is also provided that will run the
device pairing utility provided by ipheth-pair when the ipheth
module is loaded by the kernel. This will ensure that any devices
connected to the system that cause the loading of the module will
also be paired to the system. However, this functionality is also
provided (in an arguably better way) by the udev rules that ship
with ipheth-pair, so it is not necessary to install this file.
Unless you really want to :)
